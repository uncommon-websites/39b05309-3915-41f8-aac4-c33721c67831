    "prompt": "Medium-wide environmental documentary photograph of a European dental practice manager (aged 30-55, gender-neutral) sitting at an organized desk in a modern, well-lit dental practice back office. The manager is dressed in smart casual business attire, smiling with quiet confidence and subtle relief. The workspace is clean and authentic, with quality office furniture, minimalist European design, and soft natural daylight (cool-neutral, 5000-6000K) streaming in. Soft blue undertones and occasional yellow accents appear naturally in the environmentâ€”perhaps a folder, a pen, or a small desk accessory. Background shows organized shelving and subtle dental practice details (such as a plant, blurred professional certificates, or a calendar) but no visible tech, screens, or any text. The atmosphere is calm, efficient, and welcoming, with moderate depth of field (sharp subject, softly blurred background). The overall mood is one of professional satisfaction and order, reflecting a transition from chaos to clarity.",
